# requirements.txt for Reviewer-Recommendation-engine
# Inferred from attached modules: bm25_query.py, RRF_Ensemble.py, Re-Ranking.py
# - Core: numpy
# - PDF extraction: PyMuPDF (imported as `fitz` in code)
# - Sentence-transformer based ranking (Sentence Transformer module is used by RRF/reevaluator)
# - Optional/likely: torch, transformers, scikit-learn, faiss for nearest-neighbor search, rank_bm25 if building BM25 index

numpy>=1.21
pymupdf>=1.22.0   # provides `fitz` used for PDF text extraction

# Sentence Transformer & NLP stack (used by `Sentence_Transformer.py` imported by RRF_Ensemble)
sentence-transformers>=2.2.2
transformers>=4.30.0
scikit-learn>=1.0
rank-bm25>=0.2.2
nltk
wordfreq
streamlit



# Notes:
# - If you don't use FAISS, you can omit `faiss-cpu`.
# - For `torch`, follow the official install instructions for CUDA support if you have a GPU.
# - `sentence-transformers` will pull `transformers` and other deps, but pinning them helps avoid surprises.
# - Local modules like `preprocessing` are not included here.
